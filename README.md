# GeodesyBasicComputing
基于Matlab的高斯投影坐标批量转化程序
## 主要功能
* 自由选择高斯投影参考椭球（CGCS2000椭球、WGS84椭球、克拉索夫斯基椭球）
* 自定义椭球参数
* 批量计算
* 表格计算
* 高斯正算
* 高斯反算
* 交会计算：前方交会、后方交会
* 角度与弧度的相互转化
* 中央子午线经度计算
* 良好的用户体验及清爽的UI设计
* etc
## 如何使用
 
下载全部代码及图标素材，在Matlab里运行GaussPositiveFormula.m
 
### Prerequisites
 
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
 
```
Give examples
```
 
### Installing
 
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running
 
Say what the step will be
 
```
Give the example
```
 
And repeat
 
```
until finished
```
 
End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
 
## Running the tests
 
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
 
### Break down into end to end tests
 
Explain what these tests test and why
 
```
Give an example
